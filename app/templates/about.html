        WakeMate is a smart, real-time AI drowsiness detection system designed to help drivers stay alert and safe. It uses computer vision and deep learning to monitor facial states and detect signs of fatigue using a standard webcam. Gemini and ElevenLabs API is utilzied to provide the user with dynamic conversational alerts and safety suggestions.

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        WakeMate is an AI-powered real-time drowsiness detection system designed to prevent fatigue-related accidents by monitoring the driver's facial behavior using only a standard webcam. Built using OpenCV and Dlib, the system continuously detects and extracts facial regions via landmarks, preprocessing these frames before feeding them into our custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch. The CNN classifies whether the driver's eyes are open or closed and whether the driver is yawning, all in real time. If both eyes remain closed beyond a set threshold of consecutive frames, WakeMate flags the user as drowsy. What sets WakeMate apart is its intelligent alerting mechanism powered by Gemini and ElevenLabs APIs. Upon detecting drowsiness, Gemini generates a natural, context-aware voice prompt — such as suggesting a break, hydration, or music — which is then synthesized into speech using ElevenLabs and played back to the user. This creates a dynamic, human-like interaction designed to re-engage attention and encourage safer driving behavior. WakeMate was fine-tuned with real-user data for improved accuracy and is lightweight, privacy-conscious, and easily deployable.

                    <h3>How We Started</h3>
                    <p>WakeMate began with a moment that could have changed everything. In 2022, our team member Dylan Matthews fell asleep at the wheel - a near-miss that became a wake-up call. That experience sparked a mission: to build something that could help drivers like Dylan stay alert and safe on the road.</p>

                    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                    <p>At WakeMate, our vision is simple: to make every driver feel safer behind the wheel. We believe that technology should do more than entertain - it should protect. By combining computer vision, deep learning, and real-time feedback, we're building a tool that empowers drivers to stay focused, alert, and in control. Safety isn't just a feature - it's the foundation.</p>

                    <h3>The Future</h3>
                    <p>Looking ahead, we see WakeMate evolving into a smart companion for drivers everywhere. We’re working toward seamless integration with vehicles, wearable tech, and more intuitive alert systems. As our models improve and our user base grows, so does our potential to prevent accidents and make roads safer - one alert at a time.</p>
